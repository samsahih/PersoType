# PersoType
Personality test demo application

Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.



You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html



An example could be
Landing screen
Start personality test
Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just build CRUD, with in memory DB)
Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait.


It is a plus if you write some unit-tests.
